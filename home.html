       <h2>ISPSC History</h2>
       <p>The Ilocos Sur Polytechnic State College (ISPSC) was created by virtue of RA 8547 authored 
       by the then Congressman of the 2nd District of Ilocos Sur, Hon. Eric D. Singson converting the then 
       Ilocos Sur Polytechnic College (ISPC) into a state college. The charter was signed into law by 
       President Fidel V. Ramos on February 24, 1998. The then Ilocos Sur Polytechnic College was 
       created by virtue of RA 7960 also authored by then Congressman Eric D. Singson and signed into 
       law on March 29, 1995. The law converted the then Ilocos Sur Agricultural College (ISAC) into a 
       polytechnic college integrating into it seven vocational-technical and general academic secondary 
       schools in the second district of Ilocos Sur namely: Narvacan School of Fisheries NASOF), Southern 
       Ilocos Sur School of Fisheries (SISSOF), Ilocos Sur Experimental Station and Pilot School of Cottage 
       Industries (ISESPSCI), Tagudin General Comprehensive High School (TGCHS), Cervantes National 
       Agro-Industrial School (CNAIS), Suyo National High School and Salcedo National High School. After 
       its conversion into a state college, two of the campuses, Suyo Campus and Salcedo Campus, were 
       reverted back to the Department of Education.</p>
